You should put the relative dll(dynamic link library) files to using libpng library:

	* libpngxx.lib (xx is version number)
	* zlib.lib

by appropriate compilation and the version 1.6.10 or later.
libpng is available at http://www.libpng.org/ as zlib/libpng license.
You will have to download and set the appropriate zlib sources into your libpng project when you are compiling.
zlib is available at http://www.zlib.net/ as zlib license.
